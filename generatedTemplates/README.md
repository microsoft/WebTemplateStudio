# Generated Templates

This folder is for the development of the final boiler plate code that will be generated by web template studio. In the future this code will be converted into templates that the core engine can use.

## Developing Templates

Templates are being developed using the create-react-app starter kit. To run for development enter a specific folder and run:

```
npm start
```

The web app will then be available at localhost:3000.

## Templates Contained

`multi-page` - currently contains home, about and contact pages built with react and bootstrap

`blog-redux` - contains a blog page built with react, bootstrap and redux
