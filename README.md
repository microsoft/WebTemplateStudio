# Web Template Studio
*To be written*

Note: Use VSCode light mode to view the extension. Running the extension in VSCode v1.31 ~~and above will currently result in non-rendering SVGs~~. This issue was [fixed on Feb.12, 2019](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68033).

# Quick Start
Clone the repository and use
```
./build
```
to install dependencies, compile the client and the extension. Open `src/extension` using `VSCode` and press `F5` to run the extension. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open VSCode's extension CLI and open the extension named `Web Template Studio`.

if compiling on Mac, try:
```
bash build
```

## Developing for the Client
The client lives in the `src/client` directory. To run the client for development, navigate to `src/client` and use the command
```
yarn start
```
to begin development. The client was bootstrapped using [Create-React-App with TypeScript](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript).

## Running the client in the VSCode Extension

To see any changes made on the client within VSCode, run the instructions shown in the `Quick Start` section to rebuild the client and the extension. The resulting changes should appear in VSCode when the extension runs.

Rebuilding the client is required because the client is injected into a [VSCode Webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) using the production build of the client.

# Under the Hood
The following notes are inspired by the [vscode-webview-react](https://github.com/rebornix/vscode-webview-react) repository by [rebornix](https://github.com/rebornix):

- We inline `index.html` content in `src/extension/src/extension.ts` when creating the webview
- For all resources going to the webview, their scheme is `vscode-resource`
- We add a baseUrl `<base href="${vscode.Uri.file(path.join(this._extensionPath, 'build')).with({ scheme: 'vscode-resource' })}/">` and then all relative paths work.
