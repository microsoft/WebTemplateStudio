Microsoft Web Template Studio (_WebTS_) is a Visual Studio Code Extension that accelerates the creation of new web applications using a
wizard-based experience. WebTS enables developers to generate boilerplate code for a web application
by choosing between different front-end frameworks, back-end frameworks, pages and cloud services.
The resulting web app is well-formed, readable code that incorporates cloud services on
Azure while implementing proven patterns and best practices. Sprinkled throughout the generated code we have links to
Docs to provide useful insights. WebTS was created using TypeScript and React. Different combinations of generated code
are merged together by [Core Template Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/CoreTemplateStudio), which was made using .NET Core.

# Documentation

- [Installing the extension](/docs/install.md)
- [Getting started with the codebase](/docs/getting-started-developers.md)
- [Terminology for developers](/docs/terminology.md)

## SHA256

Visual Studio Code extensions are currently not signed. WebTS provides the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) of each version we publish. You can find the current extensions sha256 value in the following files:

- staging-weekly: [sha256-staging-weekly.md](sha256-staging-weekly.md)

To verify the integrity of the package, download the vsix from the Marketplace, calculate the hash of the package using the powershell command ‘Get-FileHash’ or any other tool that allows you to calculate the packages hash, and compare both.

## Instruction To Use

- Open **VSCode**
- Press `ctrl+shift+p` in Windows/Linux or `⇧⌘P` in Mac to open VSCode's extension launcher
- Type/Select `Web Template Studio: Launch` and press `Enter` to launch the extension

## Example Scenario

I need a full-stack web app that stores data in a Cosmos database.

## Features

Web Template Studio approaches full-stack web app creation using the following three attribute sets:

- **Frameworks**: First, which frameworks do you want to use for your frontend and backend? We currently support two frameworks for frontend: _[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)_, _[Angular](https://angular.io/)_ and two frameworks for backend: _[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)_, _[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)_. We also provide a dependency checker to make sure you have the required version of Node and/or Python installed.
- **App pages**: Next, to accelerate app creation, we provide a number of app page templates that you can use to add common UI pages into your new app. The current page templates include: _blank page_, common layouts (*e.g., master detail) and pages that implement common patterns (*e.g., grid, list). Using the wizard, add as many of the pages as you need, providing a name for each one, and we'll generate them for you.
- **Cloud Services**: Lastly, you specify which Azure cloud services you want to use, and we'll build out the framework for the services into your app including tagging 'TODO' items. Currently supported services cover storage (_Azure Cosmos DB_), and compute (_Azure Functions_).

Once you make the selections you want and click generate, you can quickly extend the generated code.
