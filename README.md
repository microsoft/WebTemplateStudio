# Web Template Studio

Web Template Studio (_WebTS_) is a Visual Studio Code Extension that accelerates the creation of new Web apps using a
wizard-based experience. The resulting Web application is well-formed, readable code that incorporates cloud services on
Azure while implementing proven patterns and best practices. Sprinkled throughout the generated code we have links to
Docs to provide useful insights.

## Example Scenario

I need a Fullstack web app that stores blog posts in a Cosmos database.

## Features

Web Template Studio approaches web app creation using the following four attribute sets:

- **Project type**: First, what type of application are you building? We currently support only one type: _Fullstack Application_.
- **Frameworks**: Next, which frameworks do you want to use for your frontend and backend? We currently support one framework for frontend: _[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)_ and one framework for backend: _[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)_.
- **App pages**: To accelerate app creation, we provide a number of app page templates that you can use to add common UI pages into your new app. The current page templates include: _blank page_, common layouts (*e.g., master/detail) and pages that implement common patterns (*e.g., grid, list). Using the wizard, add as many of the pages as you need, providing a name for each one, and we'll generate them for you.
- **Cloud Services**: Lastly, you specify which Azure cloud services you want to use, and we'll build out the framework for the services into your app including tagging 'TODO' items. Currently supported services cover storage (_Azure Cosmos DB_), and compute (_Azure Functions_).

Once you make the selections you want and click generate, you can quickly extend the generated code.
