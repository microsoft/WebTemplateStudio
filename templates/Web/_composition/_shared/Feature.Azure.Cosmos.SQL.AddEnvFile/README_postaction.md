### Cosmos Database

**Do Not share the keys stored in the .env file publicly.**
The Cosmos database will take approximately 5 minutes to deploy. Upon completion of deployment,
a notification will appear in VS Code and your connection string will be automatically added in
the .env file. The schema and operations for the Cosmos database are defined in `/backend` folder.
Additional documentation can be found here: [Cosmos Docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/services/azure-cosmos.md).
