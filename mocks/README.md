# Generated Templates

This folder is for the development of the final boiler plate code that will be generated by web template studio. In the future this code will be converted into templates that the core engine can use.

## React

Contains the list, grid and master detail pages made with react front-end and express back-end. The react front-end is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the express back-end is based on the [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

The react templates can be run using:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

After starting the web app the front-end will be available at localhost:3000 and the back-end will be available at localhost:3001. Further details can be found in the README located in the `react` folder.
