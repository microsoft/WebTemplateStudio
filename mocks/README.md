# Generated Templates

This folder is for the development of the final boiler plate code that will be generated by web template studio. In the future this code will be converted into templates that the core engine can use.

## Developing Templates

Templates are being developed using the create-react-app starter kit and express-generator. To run for development enter a specific folder and run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

The web app will then be available at localhost:3000 and backend API at localhost:3001.

## Templates Contained

`multi-page` - Currently contains about, contact, home and blog pages. Blog is connected to a express backend and stores comments in a Cosmos Database.

`blog-redux` - Contains a blog page built with react, bootstrap and redux.

`materialui-multi-page` - Contains a list, grid and master detail page built with react, material-ui and an express back end. The back end template contains code for a connection to Cosmos that is commented out in the /server/routes folder. To use Cosmos uncomment the code in /server/routes, rename .env-change-me to .env and add your connection string to the .env file.
