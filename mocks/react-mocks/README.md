## Getting Started

In the root directory of the project...

1. Install node modules `yarn install` or `npm install`.
2. Start development server `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Next Steps

### Sample Data

Replace the sample data stored in /server/sampleData.js.
Replace the default images stored in /src/images.

### Adding a New Page

1. Create a folder in `/src/components` with your react components.
2. Add a route for your page to `/src/App.js`.
3. Add a button to the navigation bar in `/src/components/NavBar/index.js`.

### Cosmos Database

**Do Not share the keys stored in the .env file publicly.**

The Cosmos database will take approximately 5 minutes to deploy. Upon completion of deployment,
a notification will appear in VS Code and your connection string will be automatically added
the .env file. The schema and operations for the Cosmos database are defined in `/server` folder.
Additional documentation can be found here: [Cosmos Docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/services/azure-cosmos.md).

### Azure Functions

An Azure Function with a Node runtime stack and HTTP trigger has been deployed to Azure. Microsoft Web Template Studio
has also generated a folder containing the code deployed to Azure Functions. To edit and redeploy the Azure
Function it is recommended to install the [Azure Functions Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). Additional documentation can be found here: [Azure Function Docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/services/azure-functions.md).

### Deployment

The generated templates can be deployed to Azure App Service using the following steps:

1. In the root directory of the project `yarn build` or `npm build` to create a build folder.
2. Move the build folder inside the server folder.
3. Deploy the server folder to Azure App Service using the [Azure App Service Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice).
4. If a database is used, add the environment variables defined in .env to your Application Settings.
5. Consider adding authentication and securing back-end API's by following [Azure App Service Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-security).

## File Structure

The front-end is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and the
back-end is based on [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). The front
end is served on http://localhost:3000/ and the back-end on http://localhost:3001/. During local
development front-end and back-end communicate via a proxy defined in the package.json.
